# AND101 Project 3 - AnimalApps

Submitted by: Amrit Kaur

Time spent: 1.5 hours spent in total

## Summary

NetflixPets is an android app that has an interface modeled after Netflix's log-in screen. However, the app is designed as if pets could have their own Netflix accounts!

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: üê∂üì∫üì±

## Application Features

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [x] Pick an app screenshot to duplicate
  - Be sure to add the screenshot to "Chosen Screenshot" below.
- [x] Create a runnable app that displays an Animal Version of your chosen screenshot
- [x] Layout uses one (1) or more ConstraintLayout
- [x] Layout uses one (1) or more ImageView
- [x] Layout uses three (3) or more TextViews

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [ ] Create a custom-shape Button using Shape Drawables
- [ ] Customize the text fonts by creating new Font Resources
- [ ] Add Tooltips to your Views to help users understand how to navigate the UI
- [ ] Create a second layout, this time for an original, personal app idea

The following EXTRA features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you added to improve the app!

## Chosen Screenshot

I have chosen to duplicate the following layout from the NetflixPets app:

<img src='https://media.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Manage-your-child-profile-settings-on-Netflix.png' title='Chosen Screenshot' width='' alt='Chosen Screenshot' />

Note: I chose the far left image to replicate for this app.

## Notes

This is was a fun project that allowed me to learn more about layouts and constraints! I would love to learn more about adding more personalization in future projects!
